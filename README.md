# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I have always wanted to complete a projects on games to further my learning. 

This software that I wrote is a classic game of tic tac toe. This program will handle player input, alternate turns, and check for win or draw condition on the 3x3 grid.

The purpose of this software is for me to gain a foundation in game development and for others to compete against each other.
